**Atomic Habits** by **James Clear** is a book about forming habits, which we never stop doing, consciously or unconsciously, since the day we were born. The book is therefore highly relatable. Hardly a chapter went by without me thinking "hey this had worked for me" or "now this might just work".

Here are 15 points from this book I would constantly remind myself of:

***

# 1. Assume an Identity

You can acquire a habit by assuming an identity. For example, it would be easier to quit smoking by saying 

`I am not a smoker` 

than

`I am quitting`. 

> I assumed the identity of a Software Engineer and thus habits like listening to podcasts and doing side projects come natural to me.

> My Game Dev journey also started with `fake it til I make it`. I would look at anything (not just game) from a game developer's perspective and the rest just came natural.

# 2. Start Small
If you divide your goal into `100` small bits and improve `1%` in each bit, you will accumulate an enormous improvement.

# 3. Be Loud and Clear
A clear message anchors the behavior. 

`I will do 10 burpees after I shut my computer for lunch` 

is a much clearer message than 

`I will exercise every day`.

# 4. Self-Control?

The people with the best self-control are the ones least need it. Try not to expose yourself in an undesirable environment.
> The best way for me to resist eating potato chips is not to buy any in the first place.

# 5. Temptation Bundling
Pair the habits you want to have with the habits you already have (and love!).

> I have always wanted to make my own breakfast as the choices eating outside were too limited in Singapore, but I never really pulled through. I did, however, started to make breakfast when I got my coffee machine - I love making coffee and latte art and that drags me out of bed, then I just make a breakfast "along the way".

# 6. Environment
* What you surround yourself with matters: leave a book on your pillow, make piano the first thing you see when you back home...
* We imitate the people we envy, be among them
* It’s much easier to love something when it is the "normal behaviour" in your environment (laszlo chess)
* Try to form a habit with people that already have something common with you

# 7. Make it Easy
Start your habit with `x` minutes and `x` minutes only. It should always be just below the point where it starts to feel like work.

> I am still half way but I found it much easier if I time myself to play and only play 30 minutes of piano every day.

# 8. Instant Gratification
Match long term payouts with Instant Gratification, which is valued more by us (human).

# 9. Make it Satisfying
Especially towards the end! What's rewarded will be repeated, what’s punished will be avoided.

# 10. Never Miss it Twice
First time miss is accident, second time miss is the start of a new (unwanted) habit.

# 11. Use a Habit Tracker 
We all like to see progress.

# 12. But...
When a measure becomes the new target, it's probably no longer a good measure.

# 13. Little Win / Challenges 
Push yourself to the edge (the comedian adds a few minutes to his routine every year). You need it to sustain your effort and habits.

# 14. Boredom
* No one (really) has an infinite reserve of passion
* It is up to you to create novelty for your habits
* Professionals stick to schedules, in any mood (even bored)

# 15. Review System

* To avoid the downside of habit, where you became so accustomed to something you stopped noticing some of the details
* You can only become better if you sustain the effort, not just the habit
* Investors take decision journal, athletes track their trainings, comedians test their jokes...
